# Math Flash

https://cardz.madmodels3d.com/

A simple flashcard game for memorizing and practicing basic arithmetic operations.

The default operation is 1-by-1 addition, but the app supports up to three digits per side of the operation. The number of digits and type of operation can be changed in the settings panel, accessed via the "wrench" button on the keypad.

### Why

This app was inspired by a personal struggle to retain multiplication tables in memory for long periods, and the process of teaching my two young children numbers and arithmetic.
